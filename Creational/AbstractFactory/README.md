## Summary
Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.

The client code calls the creation methods of a factory object instead of creating products directly with a constructor call (new operator). Since a factory corresponds to a single product variant, all its products will be compatible.

Client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces. This lets the client code work with any product variants, created by the factory object. You just create a new concrete factory class and pass it to the client code.

---
## Intent
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses by defining a "virtual" constructor.
The new operator considered harmful.

## Problem
If an application is to be portable, it needs to encapsulate platform dependencies. These "platforms" might include: windowing system, operating system, database, etc. Too often, this encapsulation is not engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements with options for all currently supported platforms begin to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.
---
## Discussion
Many designs start by using Factory Method (less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, but more complicated).

Builder focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects. Abstract Factory returns the product immediately, whereas Builder lets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.

Abstract Factory classes are often based on a set of Factory Methods, but you can also use Prototype to compose the methods on these classes.

Abstract Factory can serve as an alternative to Facade when you only want to hide the way the subsystem objects are created from the client code.

You can use Abstract Factory along with Bridge. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by Bridge can only work with specific implementations. In this case, Abstract Factory can encapsulate these relations and hide the complexity from the client code.

Abstract Factories, Builders and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons.

## Analysis

### Pros
- You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
- You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.
 
 ### Cons
  -  The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
